         "Agnes Yulo Diego (born: February 16, 1993 (1993-02-16) [age 32]), better known online as akidearest (or simply Aki), is a Filipino-American YouTuber and cosplayer known for her anime-related videos. She also did videos on Vocaloid and visual novels. Agnes is currently engaged to The Anime Man , with whom she moved together in Japan and is good friends with Misty Chronexia and CDawgVA. She has collaborated with them on numerous occasions. Agnes has an ongoing series on her channel called \"Otaku Monthly Favorites\", but she also does anime and manga reviews. She currently resides in Tokyo, Japan, along with her boyfriend. Agnes was born in Bakersfield, California to parents of Filipino ethnicity and spent most of her childhood in Virginia. Later, she moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Before she became a professional YouTuber, she graduated as a Chief Petty Officer from JROTC and spent the next four years on orientation with the US Marine Corps. She created her current channel in 2014, she has stated that she created her first account back in 2006, not disclosing the name of it, which she made Anime Music Videos (AMV), but she stopped making these videos due to how time consuming they were. Agnes is very eccentric and bubbly in her videos, which she claims is not the case in her real life, especially during her younger years, in which she depicted the very generic, introverted, asocial Otaku, even sometimes bordering on weeaboo. Her family knows she's into anime, manga, video games and cosplay, and it's well known among her YouTube fanbase that she's a hentai lover, especially tentacle hentai, which she is not ashamed of much (although her family doesn't know this stuff for obvious reasons). In her parodies of anime, she's shown to be very vindictive (for example, in her Death Note parody, she sets up a club for weaboos to sign up, causing them to die and kills an innocent man) and malicious (she also writes the name of a dying patient on it and flips them off), though they are presented in a comedic manner.

         "Agnes Yulo Diego (born: February 16, 1993 (1993-02-16) [age 32]), better known online as akidearest (or simply Aki), is a Filipino-American YouTuber and cosplayer known for her anime-related videos. She also did videos on Vocaloid and visual novels. Agnes is currently engaged to The Anime Man , with whom she moved together in Japan and is good friends with Misty Chronexia and CDawgVA. She has collaborated with them on numerous occasions. Agnes has an ongoing series on her channel called \"Otaku Monthly Favorites\", but she also does anime and manga reviews. She currently resides in Tokyo, Japan, along with her boyfriend. Agnes was born in Bakersfield, California to parents of Filipino ethnicity and spent most of her childhood in Virginia. Later, she moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Before she became a professional YouTuber, she graduated as a Chief Petty Officer from JROTC and spent the next four years on orientation with the US Marine Corps. She created her current channel in 2014, she has stated that she created her first account back in 2006, not disclosing the name of it, which she made Anime Music Videos (AMV), but she stopped making these videos due to how time consuming they were. Agnes is very eccentric and bubbly in her videos, which she claims is not the case in her real life, especially during her younger years, in which she depicted the very generic, introverted, asocial Otaku, even sometimes bordering on weeaboo. Her family knows she's into anime, manga, video games and cosplay, and it's well known among her YouTube fanbase that she's a hentai lover, especially tentacle hentai, which she is not ashamed of much (although her family doesn't know this stuff for obvious reasons). In her parodies of anime, she's shown to be very vindictive (for example, in her Death Note parody, she sets up a club for weaboos to sign up, causing them to die and kills an innocent man) and malicious (she also writes the name of a dying patient on it and flips them off), though they are presented in a comedic manner.
