         "James William Barkley III (born: August 26, 1994 (1994-08-26) [age 31]),[citation needed] better known online as AnimatedJames (formerly MegaJames Studio), is an American former YouTuber, animator, artist, musician, and voice actor. He's known for his parody animations of Sonic the Hedgehog and My Little Pony. He's also created his own series including Seniors, C Students, Off Saving the World, etc. James left YouTube in 2018 due to getting involved in drama related to eproctophilia, coprophilia, and pedophilia.[citation needed] James Barkley was born on August 26, 1994 in New York City. As a child, James felt he couldn't relate to other people's interest, including his family and friends. He said he had attempted to fit by acting like others, which is how he also felt about his YouTube persona. He had gained an interest in drawing around that time, being self taught since he was 13 years old. James has claimed to be emotionally abused by his parents, which led to him to live with his siblings and never contacting his parents again.[citation needed] From late 2016 and early 2017, he briefly received medication, talked with two therapists, and began online counseling. However, these would all end due to his family healthcare plan ending. After retiring from the internet, James briefly worked at several jobs, including as a graphic designer in a print shop and at Old Navy. Around 2020, James became homeless for about three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that while it was difficult being homeless, it also helped him reflect on his life. He briefly lived in a homeless shelter before moving in with his friends. On January 11, James was able to get back onto medications and therapy, saying he's been getting better.[citation needed] James originally created a Newgrounds account in 2008 where he created parody animations; one of those series including Sonic goes to Chaos High School. In February 2009, he created a YouTube channel called MegaJames12, but he didn't start making videos until the summer of that year. On this channel, he posted animations featuring himself and his original characters, gaming videos, and reviews. This channel was likely abandoned once he started uploading to the MegaJames Studios YouTube channel, but it wasn't deleted until sometime between October 7, 2011 and January 1, 2013. He also had a MegaJames12 DeviantArt account that he later deactivated. While the MegaJames12 channel has been mostly lost and forgotten about, a fan did reupload 20 videos to YouTube back in 2012. In 2011, the Sonic goes to Chaos High School series was reuploaded onto YouTube, and it received millions of views. Soon after seeing the potential of his animations, James created a new YouTube channel called MegaJames Studios on June 11, 2011. Like his Newgrounds account, he would upload parody animations as well as skits involving his avatar. Many of these videos would become hugely popular, with the most popular being Sonic VS Rainbow Dash. However, the MegaJames Studios channel was deleted after his computer crashed, but he would create a new channel on January 20, 2013.[citation needed] This new channel would be similar to MegaJames Studio, even having old videos reuploaded onto AnimatedJames. However, this channel would also have new original series, including Seniors and C Students. James's new channel would get many views and subscribers on YouTube. He would continue to upload skits and parody videos of Sonic the Hedgehog, My Little Pony, and Teen Titans Go. He would also occasionally post live action skits involving himself. [citation needed] Sonic goes to Chaos High School was a series originally created in 2008 on James's Newgrounds account. The series follows the C Student, Sonic the Hedgehog who goes through the antics of High School and the other students. There are only two episodes in the series, with the second episode being split into two parts. This series is about characters from Sonic the Hedgehog and My Little Pony fighting each other. There are four episodes created with the first one being released on February 3, 2013. Seniors is a comedy series that involves a group of friends in high school. All of the characters are exaggerated versions of real life friends he knows. He uploaded the first episode on February 3, 2013 called \"Cancer Crusaders\". This would be the only full length episode, as James later announced in an update video that Seniors would be cancelled and reworked into C Students. Two short skits were also uploaded titled \"Day Dreaming\" and \"Fuq The Police\". The skit \"Fuq The Police\" would later be privated by James for unknown reasons. C Students is a comedy series that was created in 2014. Similarly to Seniors, this series involves three friends in high school. However, the characters were solely original as opposed to the Seniors characters. There are only three episodes created, with the third episode under the name \"Creative Types\". The second episode remains incomplete. On May 10, 2014, an anonymous user on 4chan posted a link to a Tumblr page called Sonic-Girls. The blog posted comics depicting the female Sonic characters farting and defecating. The artist went under the pseudonym, AndySonic who created another fetish comic series called Hailey Flower, which he later claimed was based on a real friend accidentally farting in his face (Though later, he confirmed the friend was fake.). Right after it was mentioned on 4chan, Sonic-Girls was deleted. Some people suspected that Andy was James, since their art styles were similar. They also pointed out how some of the Sonic characters on the Tumblr blog depicted were minors. [citation needed] Many fans were disgusted at his fetish and depiction of minors in his comics. James had originally denied the accusations of him having a fart fetish, but James went onto create another DeviantArt page called WeirdoAnimatedJames dedicated to eproctophilia. He would also post more sexualized art on his main Twitter, DeviantArt, and Tumblr accounts. On his website, he claims that he'd been drawing eproctophilia art before he realized it and was aware of how weird it was, though says it's a passion of his. James later said that he wished he created fetish and NSFW artwork first before making comedic videos. Through August of 2015, James attended the My Little Pony convention, BronyCon. On August 7, James was waiting in line for a group meet up, where a fan wanted him to draw on his face. James initially agreed, but an SJW in the crowd chastised James since he thought permanent marker was poisonous to the skin. While that was happening, a crowd in the back was singing loudly. James becomes more irritated and annoyed in the video, eventually getting to the point of yelling. This clip was uploaded onto YouTube on August 8. James did make a comment on the video saying how angry he was that he was called out like that. Many of James's fans did defend him on his actions.[citation needed] During these days, he was heavily criticized for being very toxic and rude to other artists and guests at BronyCon. One example was when James made fun of an artist named LeekFish and made rape jokes towards her at his panel. She'd said that James promised to not tell those jokes at Everfree Northwest, but after it was told, she was harassed by other guests at her booth. On Twitter, James apologized to her saying that they were jokes and not to take it seriously, though LeekFish didn't accept the apology. This eventually resulted in James being banned from BronyCon.[citation needed] Around 2014, James began an online relationship with an artist named Michaela Groves, also known online as ToxicSoul77 after talking with each other on Skype. However, at the time, Michaela was 16-17 while James was 19-20 years old, with rumors spreading that he could have groomed her. Many people would go onto to call him a pedophile and a groomer. James had attempt to defuse the drama by saying that the age of consent in New York (where he lives) is 17, but people still criticized his relationship. On December 29, 2015, James announced on Twitter that Michaela broke up with him following the drama. On August 19, 2019, the voice actress for Penny from C Students, Awkward Marina posted a document on Twitter saying she had left C Students since the show had many sexually explicit material and James had wanted to date her, even suggesting he would fly out to her location; she was also 17 at the time. When she left, James became furious and allegedly encouraged his fanbase to harass her. Years later, he admitted he failed to recognize the imbalance of the relationship and wish he hadn't done so.[citation needed] Following multiple controversies, James planned to leave the internet after uploading the final episode of C Students On February 11, 2016. He did express on social media that he was suffering from depression and social anxiety, which decreased his interest for YouTube. However, after the positive reception of Creative Types, James decided he would stick onto YouTube. He would create more parody animations as well as work on a web comic series called Off Saving the World. On July 16, 2018, James uploaded a video on YouTube announcing the retirement of his channel. He stated while he was still working on OSTW, he said he didn't work on his mental health and psychology while on YouTube, which is why James got into drama. James said he was going to fix his health rather than upload videos on YouTube. He went onto disable the like to dislike ratio and comments. However, Off Saving the World was cancelled after James stopped uploading the comics. Many people had speculated on James's disappearance and where he is nowadays or if he's still alive. On March 25, 2022 the channel reached 1 million subscribers, but it's unknown whether or not he'll receive a YouTube Play Button.[citation needed] In 2019, a YouTube channel named Neuroddic started uploading animations that shared similarities with James' art style. This has lead many people, including the YouTuber Turkey Tom, to suspect that this channel was created by James under a pseudonym. During an art livestream hosted by James on January 24, 2025, he was asked about this account. He responded by saying that he won't confirm nor deny the account was his, since he's aware that people know about his previous alt accounts. This livestream was later removed after he quit doing art livestreams. On July 16, 2022, James posted a Twitlonger explaining the drama and his four year hiatus. In the document, he reflects on how terrible of a person he was and says he deserves all the criticism due to his fetish art, toxicity, and underage relationship with Michaela. He says he didn't realize he had many issues he could fix, which made him out to be narcissistic and toxic, in turn, ruining friendships and being mocked. He says that starting in 2020, he began experiencing depressing thoughts about himself, but eventually recovered and improved his behavior because of the people within his life. James plans to take some therapy or medication once he's able to afford the money. He concludes by saying he's not trying to seek forgiveness and still deserves the hatred online. On December 5, 2022, James was interviewed by YouTube commentator, DaftPina to clarify some information and how he's doing nowadays. He confirmed that he's still active, drawing commissions on an NSFW account, but he doesn't wish to specify what account. Though he wouldn't care if someone confirms the NSFW account belongs to James. He hasn't considered going back to his AnimatedJames persona, wanting to move on with his NSFW art. On January 27, 2023, James made a Twitter-thread where he said he was thinking of creating a new account where he can create fetish art more creatively, rather than financially. He's said he was hoping to move on from his past and controversies, promising to not act like how he did from 2014 and attempting to gain happiness from making NSFW art. Around the same time, James would create a new Twitter account under the name IneptOutcast, where he primarily posts NSFW art along with doing commissions and occasionally posting original music. The IneptOutcast account is currently inactive as of March 26, 2025, as James stated that while he still enjoys making art, he's simply isn't mentally or socially fit to post art or anything on social media, feeling like he's intruding where he don't belong, and as long as that's case, he should stay gone....",

         "Daniel Cockett (born: November 11, 1997 (1997-11-11) [age 28]), better known online as SB737 (short for SonicBoom737), is an English gaming YouTuber who is known for making videos on Minecraft and formerly various speedruns of Sonic the Hedgehog. Daniel created his main channel on January 1, 2012. It was supposed to be named SonicBoom as he generally wanted to share his Sonic the Hedgehog speed-running videos but during that time YouTube's username system only allowed a unique name. So when YouTube auto-generated a name 'SonicBoom737' he liked it, remarking that it had a nice ring to it. His first video was uploaded on January 7, 2012. He would publish his speed-runs and world record videos on the Sonic The Hedgehog games while also playing miscellaneous games like New Super Mario Bros. Wii. His name would be later shortened to 'SB737' after he thought of moving away from the Sonic games and growing up his channel by playing other games. On October 28, 2014, after becoming inspired by watching Minecraft YouTubers like Stampylonghead, Daniel would go on to start his first official and longest running Minecraft Let's Play series on the Xbox, the \"SB's Awesome World\". Slowly, Minecraft would become the primary content of his channel. In the 31st episode of his Minecraft series, Daniel first used his penguin skin. A second channel was created by Daniel on November 9, 2013, but it would remain unused. On September 19, 2016, he made his official second channel MoreSB to upload extra content. This is where he plays games that he enjoys but didn't do so well on his main. He mainly uploaded Sonic the Hedgehog videos with some other games here and there. SB Speedruns was created on April 9, 2020. It was only made for the Sonic the Hedgehog speedruns. On November 18, 2020, Daniel officially ended his Awesome World series on his main channel with the 505th episode. It later continued for a bit on his second channel MoreSB, before it ended at the 513th episode. On October 28, 2025, exactly 11 years after the series had started, he uploaded a video of him revisiting the world. On December 1, 2020, the unused channel was renamed to SB737 Shorts featuring various bloopers and outtakes from his main channel. SB737 joined the 'Shady Oaks' SMP during March of 2021, which had other YouTubers like DanTDM, iBallisticSquid, and Thinknoodles, which he first stream on Twitch on March 17, 2021. For that Daniel created a separate, SB737 Live, to upload the highlights of his Twitch live streams. Possibly his greatest series ever is his 100 day Hardcore series, where he had to survive 100 days in his Hardcore world one video at a time. He has done a lot of achievements, such as acquiring the legendary 1.14 \"God Armour\", a stack of Enchanted Golden Apples that are put on display, defeated a warden in direct combat, made a lot of farms, made a mountain out of gold, constructed a palace made out of emeralds, trapped every mob in Minecraft (including the Warden), got every beacon possible (including a Level 4 Netherite Beacon) and some more. Recently however, he started over his series due to a mistake he made while using a pig cannon to get to his world border with his dog Buddy. Now he can't get any hostile mob drops due to a farm of his back at his base, where he builds. Making him resort to going to structures or the Nether to get barely any mob loot. Also he now has a limited supply of most items and blocks, due to most being back at his base and the fact he can only make mob farms in the nether, nor has any way of getting totems of undying, meaning he is at higher risk of dying. He has made a new base and has made some food farms to keep himself alive as well as Buddy as of April 20th, 2024. Soon though he managed to get back to his original place after regaining his ender chest and continued the series normally. He got back home with a pig cannon, however due to slimes not spawning, he uses a panda breeder farm to get the slime needed. He has returned home via the pig cannon. He said he would end his Hardcore world series by dying when he reached 10,000 days. Many of his fans kept giving ideas on how to make his Hardcore death more \"epic\" by getting the rarest death message and many other unique ways. Some also said he should just change it to Survival and continue playing; that way, even though he would be no longer playing Hardcore, fans still got to see content of him playing the Hardcore world but in Survival. Others just said not to die and continue the series. Despite all the begging not to end the series and suggestions and ideas from fans, SB didn't seem to respond to them and uploaded a video in April 5, 2025 where he said that in the video, he would end the series on 10,000 days by jumping in the End void. At the end the video, he stood on top of the End obsidian pillar, threw all items he had on his inventory into the void apart from his armor, said some goodbye messages, and jumped off the pillar into the void like he said. At the last second where he would had died, the screen faded to black with a \"thank you for everything\" text, which made it seemed like he had ended his Hardcore series. However, in a video uploaded in September 6, 2025, it was revealed that he did not actually die in his Hardcore world and therefore the series did not actually end. Turns out, inside the obsidian pillar he stood on was an ender pearl chamber that was programmed so that at the last second where he would had died, the chamber activated, causing him to teleport from the void to the chamber. That chamber plus the armor he had not thrown earlier kept him alive and therefore continuing the series. In the video, he also said that the reason why he pretended to end the series was because he wanted a break from the Hardcore world. SB737 has 2 Minecraft accounts. His main account is SB737 and his alternative account is EimaJolum (the villain from his Awesome World). The main servers he has made series on are Hypixel - mc.hypixel.net (Bedwars and Skyward), Skycade - play.skycade.net (Sky High series) and he also plays some one-off episodes on The Hive - eu.hivemc.com (Droppers, Murder Mystery and Hide and Seek) SB737 does not use any texture packs except for Bedwars where he uses his 200k texture pack. The only other texture pack that has shown in his videos is the broken texture pack at the start of Friend or Foe Episode 1 and Squid's textured realm whilst playing Aquatic Adventure. MC Championship is a Minecraft tournament for YouTubers and streamers run by the Noxcrew, in which 10 teams of four compete in a series of 8 minigames decided by the participants. A point multiplier makes each game worth more as each round passes, incentivizing teams to vote for games they might be bad at early on in the event. In the end, the two teams with the most points face off in a round of ‘Dodgebolt’ to decide the winner of the tournament. This makes it possible for a team to win despite potentially having fewer points than the runner-up. Note: The following dates are according to Social Blade. Dates may vary by one or two days due to differences in time zones....",

         "MugiMikey (born: December 5, 1990 (1990-12-05) [age 35]), also known as MugiwaraMikey or ZenkaiKenny is an French-American[citation needed] YouTuber, animator, artist, and voice actor. He's known for making Sonic the Hedgehog parodies and shorts. They mostly consist of Sonic meeting someone from another franchise or criticizing the Sonic fanbase. He joined YouTube on September 9, 2009, and has created multiple parody shorts, which are now deleted. He also live streams on his channel with his friends, which consists of him drawing, animating, or playing video games. This series has Sonic meeting a character from the Sonic series or from another franchise. He meets several pop culture or meme characters such as classic Sonic, Ugandan Knuckles, Isabelle, or Goku. This usually ends up in crazy high jinks where Sonic gets involved. It was originally created 2011 where Sonic meets Classic Sonic. There are currently over 40 episodes. Papercraft Mania Adventures is a short series which has Sonic going on adventures with his friends. Unlike his usual art style, the animation is in a paper stop motion art style. They don't feature any dialogue, but it is accompanied by music in the Sega Genesis style. The series could be inspired by Sonic Mania Adventures. The first episode was made in 2019 and there are currently two episodes. Robotnikclaus was a series about two Robotnik's dressing up as Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus, causing a ruckus. A mall elf would also be forced tag along and be tortured by the two. He would eventually become the series main antagonist and try to kill them to stop them from ruining the holiday season. The Robotnikclaus videos were deleted from MugiMikey's channel because he said they \"are a risk to the channel\" in a livestream (likely due to their inherently crass and NSFW humor, alongside YouTube's change of content policies in the last decade). There are only five episodes for Robotnikclaus. Recently MugiMikey has been creating FNF animations and shorts in collaboration with RecD. They feature an ongoning story of Boyfriend and Girlfriend from the Friday Night Funkin' series meeting Sonic.exe as well as numerous shorts that specifically focus on what Sonic.exe is doing in bewteen the larger entries into the series that RecD and Mikey are making. EastBlueStudios was a YouTube channel created in 2009 which was run by MugiMikey. The channel created several abridges of the manga/anime series, One Piece. The channel ran from 2009 to 2010 creating five episodes. However, the channel was deleted after violating multiple copyright strikes. MugiGraveyard is an archive channel in which it uploads old videos that used to be on MugiMikey's main channel back from 2009. The channel was created in 2014 with only 11 videos. But the channel has become inactive since 2016. ZenkaiToons is another parody channel created in 2020 in collaboration with MugiMikey and J0topla. (Formerly collaborated with JessePajamas) It was first announced in the video \"Sonic Meets Hatsune Miku Amy\". The videos parody the anime series, Dragon Ball Z where like the Sonic Meets series, Goku also meets multiple pop culture characters. MugiBlue was a commentary channel where MugiMikey or other guests talk about upcoming news about Sonic and give their thoughts. He mainly uploaded two videos in 2016, before becoming inactive. MugiMallard is another commentary channel that was created on October 24, 2023. The channel primarily focuses on essays about certain topics, mainly being Sonic the Hedgehog and anime. A now-deleted video uploaded in 2016 parodying the arcade game Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car. In the video, Sonic, as a police officer beats up an African American, Hispanic, and a Muslim for no reason. He's then sent to court and gets away with his crimes. Another video uploaded in 2020 called Sonic Meets Female Sonic. In the video, Sonic meets a sexualized female version of himself, only to eventually find out that she's intersex and is immediately repulsed and rejects her. The video gained backlash for being offensive to the transgender community. In February 2021, MugiMikey released an official statement in his community page. He states that it was his low level sense of humor back then, but he has changed, then he apologized for the videos. The videos were deleted after this....",

         "James William Barkley III (born: August 26, 1994 (1994-08-26) [age 31]),[citation needed] better known online as AnimatedJames (formerly MegaJames Studio), is an American former YouTuber, animator, artist, musician, and voice actor. He's known for his parody animations of Sonic the Hedgehog and My Little Pony. He's also created his own series including Seniors, C Students, Off Saving the World, etc. James left YouTube in 2018 due to getting involved in drama related to eproctophilia, coprophilia, and pedophilia.[citation needed] James Barkley was born on August 26, 1994 in New York City. As a child, James felt he couldn't relate to other people's interest, including his family and friends. He said he had attempted to fit by acting like others, which is how he also felt about his YouTube persona. He had gained an interest in drawing around that time, being self taught since he was 13 years old. James has claimed to be emotionally abused by his parents, which led to him to live with his siblings and never contacting his parents again.[citation needed] From late 2016 and early 2017, he briefly received medication, talked with two therapists, and began online counseling. However, these would all end due to his family healthcare plan ending. After retiring from the internet, James briefly worked at several jobs, including as a graphic designer in a print shop and at Old Navy. Around 2020, James became homeless for about three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that while it was difficult being homeless, it also helped him reflect on his life. He briefly lived in a homeless shelter before moving in with his friends. On January 11, James was able to get back onto medications and therapy, saying he's been getting better.[citation needed] James originally created a Newgrounds account in 2008 where he created parody animations; one of those series including Sonic goes to Chaos High School. In February 2009, he created a YouTube channel called MegaJames12, but he didn't start making videos until the summer of that year. On this channel, he posted animations featuring himself and his original characters, gaming videos, and reviews. This channel was likely abandoned once he started uploading to the MegaJames Studios YouTube channel, but it wasn't deleted until sometime between October 7, 2011 and January 1, 2013. He also had a MegaJames12 DeviantArt account that he later deactivated. While the MegaJames12 channel has been mostly lost and forgotten about, a fan did reupload 20 videos to YouTube back in 2012. In 2011, the Sonic goes to Chaos High School series was reuploaded onto YouTube, and it received millions of views. Soon after seeing the potential of his animations, James created a new YouTube channel called MegaJames Studios on June 11, 2011. Like his Newgrounds account, he would upload parody animations as well as skits involving his avatar. Many of these videos would become hugely popular, with the most popular being Sonic VS Rainbow Dash. However, the MegaJames Studios channel was deleted after his computer crashed, but he would create a new channel on January 20, 2013.[citation needed] This new channel would be similar to MegaJames Studio, even having old videos reuploaded onto AnimatedJames. However, this channel would also have new original series, including Seniors and C Students. James's new channel would get many views and subscribers on YouTube. He would continue to upload skits and parody videos of Sonic the Hedgehog, My Little Pony, and Teen Titans Go. He would also occasionally post live action skits involving himself. [citation needed] Sonic goes to Chaos High School was a series originally created in 2008 on James's Newgrounds account. The series follows the C Student, Sonic the Hedgehog who goes through the antics of High School and the other students. There are only two episodes in the series, with the second episode being split into two parts. This series is about characters from Sonic the Hedgehog and My Little Pony fighting each other. There are four episodes created with the first one being released on February 3, 2013. Seniors is a comedy series that involves a group of friends in high school. All of the characters are exaggerated versions of real life friends he knows. He uploaded the first episode on February 3, 2013 called \"Cancer Crusaders\". This would be the only full length episode, as James later announced in an update video that Seniors would be cancelled and reworked into C Students. Two short skits were also uploaded titled \"Day Dreaming\" and \"Fuq The Police\". The skit \"Fuq The Police\" would later be privated by James for unknown reasons. C Students is a comedy series that was created in 2014. Similarly to Seniors, this series involves three friends in high school. However, the characters were solely original as opposed to the Seniors characters. There are only three episodes created, with the third episode under the name \"Creative Types\". The second episode remains incomplete. On May 10, 2014, an anonymous user on 4chan posted a link to a Tumblr page called Sonic-Girls. The blog posted comics depicting the female Sonic characters farting and defecating. The artist went under the pseudonym, AndySonic who created another fetish comic series called Hailey Flower, which he later claimed was based on a real friend accidentally farting in his face (Though later, he confirmed the friend was fake.). Right after it was mentioned on 4chan, Sonic-Girls was deleted. Some people suspected that Andy was James, since their art styles were similar. They also pointed out how some of the Sonic characters on the Tumblr blog depicted were minors. [citation needed] Many fans were disgusted at his fetish and depiction of minors in his comics. James had originally denied the accusations of him having a fart fetish, but James went onto create another DeviantArt page called WeirdoAnimatedJames dedicated to eproctophilia. He would also post more sexualized art on his main Twitter, DeviantArt, and Tumblr accounts. On his website, he claims that he'd been drawing eproctophilia art before he realized it and was aware of how weird it was, though says it's a passion of his. James later said that he wished he created fetish and NSFW artwork first before making comedic videos. Through August of 2015, James attended the My Little Pony convention, BronyCon. On August 7, James was waiting in line for a group meet up, where a fan wanted him to draw on his face. James initially agreed, but an SJW in the crowd chastised James since he thought permanent marker was poisonous to the skin. While that was happening, a crowd in the back was singing loudly. James becomes more irritated and annoyed in the video, eventually getting to the point of yelling. This clip was uploaded onto YouTube on August 8. James did make a comment on the video saying how angry he was that he was called out like that. Many of James's fans did defend him on his actions.[citation needed] During these days, he was heavily criticized for being very toxic and rude to other artists and guests at BronyCon. One example was when James made fun of an artist named LeekFish and made rape jokes towards her at his panel. She'd said that James promised to not tell those jokes at Everfree Northwest, but after it was told, she was harassed by other guests at her booth. On Twitter, James apologized to her saying that they were jokes and not to take it seriously, though LeekFish didn't accept the apology. This eventually resulted in James being banned from BronyCon.[citation needed] Around 2014, James began an online relationship with an artist named Michaela Groves, also known online as ToxicSoul77 after talking with each other on Skype. However, at the time, Michaela was 16-17 while James was 19-20 years old, with rumors spreading that he could have groomed her. Many people would go onto to call him a pedophile and a groomer. James had attempt to defuse the drama by saying that the age of consent in New York (where he lives) is 17, but people still criticized his relationship. On December 29, 2015, James announced on Twitter that Michaela broke up with him following the drama. On August 19, 2019, the voice actress for Penny from C Students, Awkward Marina posted a document on Twitter saying she had left C Students since the show had many sexually explicit material and James had wanted to date her, even suggesting he would fly out to her location; she was also 17 at the time. When she left, James became furious and allegedly encouraged his fanbase to harass her. Years later, he admitted he failed to recognize the imbalance of the relationship and wish he hadn't done so.[citation needed] Following multiple controversies, James planned to leave the internet after uploading the final episode of C Students On February 11, 2016. He did express on social media that he was suffering from depression and social anxiety, which decreased his interest for YouTube. However, after the positive reception of Creative Types, James decided he would stick onto YouTube. He would create more parody animations as well as work on a web comic series called Off Saving the World. On July 16, 2018, James uploaded a video on YouTube announcing the retirement of his channel. He stated while he was still working on OSTW, he said he didn't work on his mental health and psychology while on YouTube, which is why James got into drama. James said he was going to fix his health rather than upload videos on YouTube. He went onto disable the like to dislike ratio and comments. However, Off Saving the World was cancelled after James stopped uploading the comics. Many people had speculated on James's disappearance and where he is nowadays or if he's still alive. On March 25, 2022 the channel reached 1 million subscribers, but it's unknown whether or not he'll receive a YouTube Play Button.[citation needed] In 2019, a YouTube channel named Neuroddic started uploading animations that shared similarities with James' art style. This has lead many people, including the YouTuber Turkey Tom, to suspect that this channel was created by James under a pseudonym. During an art livestream hosted by James on January 24, 2025, he was asked about this account. He responded by saying that he won't confirm nor deny the account was his, since he's aware that people know about his previous alt accounts. This livestream was later removed after he quit doing art livestreams. On July 16, 2022, James posted a Twitlonger explaining the drama and his four year hiatus. In the document, he reflects on how terrible of a person he was and says he deserves all the criticism due to his fetish art, toxicity, and underage relationship with Michaela. He says he didn't realize he had many issues he could fix, which made him out to be narcissistic and toxic, in turn, ruining friendships and being mocked. He says that starting in 2020, he began experiencing depressing thoughts about himself, but eventually recovered and improved his behavior because of the people within his life. James plans to take some therapy or medication once he's able to afford the money. He concludes by saying he's not trying to seek forgiveness and still deserves the hatred online. On December 5, 2022, James was interviewed by YouTube commentator, DaftPina to clarify some information and how he's doing nowadays. He confirmed that he's still active, drawing commissions on an NSFW account, but he doesn't wish to specify what account. Though he wouldn't care if someone confirms the NSFW account belongs to James. He hasn't considered going back to his AnimatedJames persona, wanting to move on with his NSFW art. On January 27, 2023, James made a Twitter-thread where he said he was thinking of creating a new account where he can create fetish art more creatively, rather than financially. He's said he was hoping to move on from his past and controversies, promising to not act like how he did from 2014 and attempting to gain happiness from making NSFW art. Around the same time, James would create a new Twitter account under the name IneptOutcast, where he primarily posts NSFW art along with doing commissions and occasionally posting original music. The IneptOutcast account is currently inactive as of March 26, 2025, as James stated that while he still enjoys making art, he's simply isn't mentally or socially fit to post art or anything on social media, feeling like he's intruding where he don't belong, and as long as that's case, he should stay gone....",

         "Daniel Cockett (born: November 11, 1997 (1997-11-11) [age 28]), better known online as SB737 (short for SonicBoom737), is an English gaming YouTuber who is known for making videos on Minecraft and formerly various speedruns of Sonic the Hedgehog. Daniel created his main channel on January 1, 2012. It was supposed to be named SonicBoom as he generally wanted to share his Sonic the Hedgehog speed-running videos but during that time YouTube's username system only allowed a unique name. So when YouTube auto-generated a name 'SonicBoom737' he liked it, remarking that it had a nice ring to it. His first video was uploaded on January 7, 2012. He would publish his speed-runs and world record videos on the Sonic The Hedgehog games while also playing miscellaneous games like New Super Mario Bros. Wii. His name would be later shortened to 'SB737' after he thought of moving away from the Sonic games and growing up his channel by playing other games. On October 28, 2014, after becoming inspired by watching Minecraft YouTubers like Stampylonghead, Daniel would go on to start his first official and longest running Minecraft Let's Play series on the Xbox, the \"SB's Awesome World\". Slowly, Minecraft would become the primary content of his channel. In the 31st episode of his Minecraft series, Daniel first used his penguin skin. A second channel was created by Daniel on November 9, 2013, but it would remain unused. On September 19, 2016, he made his official second channel MoreSB to upload extra content. This is where he plays games that he enjoys but didn't do so well on his main. He mainly uploaded Sonic the Hedgehog videos with some other games here and there. SB Speedruns was created on April 9, 2020. It was only made for the Sonic the Hedgehog speedruns. On November 18, 2020, Daniel officially ended his Awesome World series on his main channel with the 505th episode. It later continued for a bit on his second channel MoreSB, before it ended at the 513th episode. On October 28, 2025, exactly 11 years after the series had started, he uploaded a video of him revisiting the world. On December 1, 2020, the unused channel was renamed to SB737 Shorts featuring various bloopers and outtakes from his main channel. SB737 joined the 'Shady Oaks' SMP during March of 2021, which had other YouTubers like DanTDM, iBallisticSquid, and Thinknoodles, which he first stream on Twitch on March 17, 2021. For that Daniel created a separate, SB737 Live, to upload the highlights of his Twitch live streams. Possibly his greatest series ever is his 100 day Hardcore series, where he had to survive 100 days in his Hardcore world one video at a time. He has done a lot of achievements, such as acquiring the legendary 1.14 \"God Armour\", a stack of Enchanted Golden Apples that are put on display, defeated a warden in direct combat, made a lot of farms, made a mountain out of gold, constructed a palace made out of emeralds, trapped every mob in Minecraft (including the Warden), got every beacon possible (including a Level 4 Netherite Beacon) and some more. Recently however, he started over his series due to a mistake he made while using a pig cannon to get to his world border with his dog Buddy. Now he can't get any hostile mob drops due to a farm of his back at his base, where he builds. Making him resort to going to structures or the Nether to get barely any mob loot. Also he now has a limited supply of most items and blocks, due to most being back at his base and the fact he can only make mob farms in the nether, nor has any way of getting totems of undying, meaning he is at higher risk of dying. He has made a new base and has made some food farms to keep himself alive as well as Buddy as of April 20th, 2024. Soon though he managed to get back to his original place after regaining his ender chest and continued the series normally. He got back home with a pig cannon, however due to slimes not spawning, he uses a panda breeder farm to get the slime needed. He has returned home via the pig cannon. He said he would end his Hardcore world series by dying when he reached 10,000 days. Many of his fans kept giving ideas on how to make his Hardcore death more \"epic\" by getting the rarest death message and many other unique ways. Some also said he should just change it to Survival and continue playing; that way, even though he would be no longer playing Hardcore, fans still got to see content of him playing the Hardcore world but in Survival. Others just said not to die and continue the series. Despite all the begging not to end the series and suggestions and ideas from fans, SB didn't seem to respond to them and uploaded a video in April 5, 2025 where he said that in the video, he would end the series on 10,000 days by jumping in the End void. At the end the video, he stood on top of the End obsidian pillar, threw all items he had on his inventory into the void apart from his armor, said some goodbye messages, and jumped off the pillar into the void like he said. At the last second where he would had died, the screen faded to black with a \"thank you for everything\" text, which made it seemed like he had ended his Hardcore series. However, in a video uploaded in September 6, 2025, it was revealed that he did not actually die in his Hardcore world and therefore the series did not actually end. Turns out, inside the obsidian pillar he stood on was an ender pearl chamber that was programmed so that at the last second where he would had died, the chamber activated, causing him to teleport from the void to the chamber. That chamber plus the armor he had not thrown earlier kept him alive and therefore continuing the series. In the video, he also said that the reason why he pretended to end the series was because he wanted a break from the Hardcore world. SB737 has 2 Minecraft accounts. His main account is SB737 and his alternative account is EimaJolum (the villain from his Awesome World). The main servers he has made series on are Hypixel - mc.hypixel.net (Bedwars and Skyward), Skycade - play.skycade.net (Sky High series) and he also plays some one-off episodes on The Hive - eu.hivemc.com (Droppers, Murder Mystery and Hide and Seek) SB737 does not use any texture packs except for Bedwars where he uses his 200k texture pack. The only other texture pack that has shown in his videos is the broken texture pack at the start of Friend or Foe Episode 1 and Squid's textured realm whilst playing Aquatic Adventure. MC Championship is a Minecraft tournament for YouTubers and streamers run by the Noxcrew, in which 10 teams of four compete in a series of 8 minigames decided by the participants. A point multiplier makes each game worth more as each round passes, incentivizing teams to vote for games they might be bad at early on in the event. In the end, the two teams with the most points face off in a round of ‘Dodgebolt’ to decide the winner of the tournament. This makes it possible for a team to win despite potentially having fewer points than the runner-up. Note: The following dates are according to Social Blade. Dates may vary by one or two days due to differences in time zones....",

         "MugiMikey (born: December 5, 1990 (1990-12-05) [age 35]), also known as MugiwaraMikey or ZenkaiKenny is an French-American[citation needed] YouTuber, animator, artist, and voice actor. He's known for making Sonic the Hedgehog parodies and shorts. They mostly consist of Sonic meeting someone from another franchise or criticizing the Sonic fanbase. He joined YouTube on September 9, 2009, and has created multiple parody shorts, which are now deleted. He also live streams on his channel with his friends, which consists of him drawing, animating, or playing video games. This series has Sonic meeting a character from the Sonic series or from another franchise. He meets several pop culture or meme characters such as classic Sonic, Ugandan Knuckles, Isabelle, or Goku. This usually ends up in crazy high jinks where Sonic gets involved. It was originally created 2011 where Sonic meets Classic Sonic. There are currently over 40 episodes. Papercraft Mania Adventures is a short series which has Sonic going on adventures with his friends. Unlike his usual art style, the animation is in a paper stop motion art style. They don't feature any dialogue, but it is accompanied by music in the Sega Genesis style. The series could be inspired by Sonic Mania Adventures. The first episode was made in 2019 and there are currently two episodes. Robotnikclaus was a series about two Robotnik's dressing up as Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus, causing a ruckus. A mall elf would also be forced tag along and be tortured by the two. He would eventually become the series main antagonist and try to kill them to stop them from ruining the holiday season. The Robotnikclaus videos were deleted from MugiMikey's channel because he said they \"are a risk to the channel\" in a livestream (likely due to their inherently crass and NSFW humor, alongside YouTube's change of content policies in the last decade). There are only five episodes for Robotnikclaus. Recently MugiMikey has been creating FNF animations and shorts in collaboration with RecD. They feature an ongoning story of Boyfriend and Girlfriend from the Friday Night Funkin' series meeting Sonic.exe as well as numerous shorts that specifically focus on what Sonic.exe is doing in bewteen the larger entries into the series that RecD and Mikey are making. EastBlueStudios was a YouTube channel created in 2009 which was run by MugiMikey. The channel created several abridges of the manga/anime series, One Piece. The channel ran from 2009 to 2010 creating five episodes. However, the channel was deleted after violating multiple copyright strikes. MugiGraveyard is an archive channel in which it uploads old videos that used to be on MugiMikey's main channel back from 2009. The channel was created in 2014 with only 11 videos. But the channel has become inactive since 2016. ZenkaiToons is another parody channel created in 2020 in collaboration with MugiMikey and J0topla. (Formerly collaborated with JessePajamas) It was first announced in the video \"Sonic Meets Hatsune Miku Amy\". The videos parody the anime series, Dragon Ball Z where like the Sonic Meets series, Goku also meets multiple pop culture characters. MugiBlue was a commentary channel where MugiMikey or other guests talk about upcoming news about Sonic and give their thoughts. He mainly uploaded two videos in 2016, before becoming inactive. MugiMallard is another commentary channel that was created on October 24, 2023. The channel primarily focuses on essays about certain topics, mainly being Sonic the Hedgehog and anime. A now-deleted video uploaded in 2016 parodying the arcade game Waku Waku Sonic Patrol Car. In the video, Sonic, as a police officer beats up an African American, Hispanic, and a Muslim for no reason. He's then sent to court and gets away with his crimes. Another video uploaded in 2020 called Sonic Meets Female Sonic. In the video, Sonic meets a sexualized female version of himself, only to eventually find out that she's intersex and is immediately repulsed and rejects her. The video gained backlash for being offensive to the transgender community. In February 2021, MugiMikey released an official statement in his community page. He states that it was his low level sense of humor back then, but he has changed, then he apologized for the videos. The videos were deleted after this....",
